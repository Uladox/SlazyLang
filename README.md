The Slacker's Lazy Language

This is an attempt to build a compiler that implements
the full lambda cube, enumerated sets, prototype based
object orientation, and utilities for intelligence based
computation all on top of lists such that lisp based
manipulation can be done to extend the language. It is
modeled afted lisp, serveral theorem provers, haskell,
io, and R. As of now it is incomplete, but still partly
implemented.
